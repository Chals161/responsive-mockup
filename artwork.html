            <h1>Past Art Works</h1>
            <p>Over the years, my artistic journey has been an exploration of the delicate balance between the environment and human existence, often blending various mediums and techniques to convey the profound interconnection between the two. My portfolio predominantly comprises oil, acrylic, and ink paintings, but it also incorporates three-dimensional elements, such as dried leaves, flowers, pebbles, and meticulously crafted newspaper origami. These unconventional materials serve as powerful symbols in conveying the themes of environmental degradation and its impact on humanity.</p>
            <p>One of my most striking works features a realistic depiction of a lush, vibrant forest where the leaves are not just painted but are also physically dried and integrated into the canvas. This artwork aims to highlight the beauty and fragility of our natural world, juxtaposed with the looming threat of deforestation and habitat loss. The contrast between the hyper-realistic leaves and the abstract background creates a stark visual representation of the chasm between nature's vitality and human-induced degradation.</p>
            <p>In another piece, I explored the concept of environmental deflation, where the vibrancy of a once-thriving garden is deflated, mirroring the declining state of our ecosystems due to pollution, climate change, and exploitation. I used a mix of oil and acrylic paints to create a surreal, almost dreamlike quality to the scene, where the wilting flowers and withering leaves embody the devastating consequences of environmental neglect.</p>
            <p>A recurring motif in my work is the intersection between humans and their environment. One of my most thought-provoking pieces combines a cityscape with elements of nature struggling to thrive amid the concrete jungle. Real pebbles and newspaper origami structures serve as poignant reminders of nature's resilience in the face of urban expansion, and the impact of our choices on the world around us. The mix of hyper-realism and abstraction in these artworks allows viewers to engage with the intricate details while contemplating the broader ecological message.</p>
            <p>In my artistic journey, I strive to inspire a deeper understanding of the environmental challenges we face, emphasizing that our actions directly influence the speed and severity of these disastrous activities. Through the synthesis of various mediums and techniques, I aim to encourage reflection on the intricate relationship between humanity and the environment, urging us all to take responsibility and action to safeguard our planet's future.</p>
