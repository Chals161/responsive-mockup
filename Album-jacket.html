            <h1>Album Cover</h1>
            <p>For my Record Album typography project, I embarked on a creative journey inspired by the distinct style of the artist I chose: Cigarettes After Sex, an indie band known for their minimalistic and monochromatic album designs. To do justice to their unique aesthetic, I sought to infuse their love-infused music into the typography, creating a visual love letter</p>

            <p>In keeping with the monochromatic theme, I aimed to add depth and character to the design by using dynamic fonts that resonated with the band's style. For the main title font, I turned to Termina, a bold and wide typeface that demanded attention and presence on the page. This choice was deliberate, as it mimicked the band's commanding presence in the indie music scene.</p>

            <p>To infuse a personal touch and evoke the feeling of a handwritten note, I incorporated Regina, a script typeface, for a quote from Cigarettes After Sex's song "Apocalypse." This addition not only echoed the band's lyrical themes but also created a connection with the audience, as if they were receiving a heartfelt message.</p>

            <p>To highlight some of my favorite songs from the band's albums, I used Termina again, but with reduced opacity, ensuring that it didn't overshadow the main attraction: the album cover. This approach allowed the viewer to appreciate the typography without detracting from the overall aesthetics.</p>

            <p>In the center of the design, I crafted an intricate illustration using Adobe Creative Cloud, resembling a flower with multiple layers. This floral metaphor symbolized the theme of love that permeates the band's music. To tie it all together, I added clouds and smoke to the background, creating a hazy, dreamlike atmosphere that resonated with the album's title. This typography project was a labor of love, seeking to capture the essence of Cigarettes After Sex's music and provide a visual representation of their artistic vision.</p>
